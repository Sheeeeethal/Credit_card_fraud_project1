Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on the critical task of detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card data. With the rise of online transactions, the need for robust fraud detection systems has become increasingly important. Leveraging various machine learning classification models, this project aims to identify the most effective approach for detecting fraudulent activities accurately and efficiently.

Key Objectives:
Data Preparation: The dataset used in this project is pre-processed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering to enhance the performance of the models.

Model Selection: Several classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting are implemented and compared to determine which one yields the highest accuracy and reliability in identifying fraudulent transactions.

Evaluation Metrics: The performance of each model is evaluated using common metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to provide a comprehensive understanding of their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Model Optimization: Techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and feature selection are employed to fine-tune the selected models, aiming to improve their performance and reduce the risk of false positives and false negatives.

Results:
Preliminary results indicate that XGBoost Classifier outperforms other models in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall and also the time taken to give us the results altogether. However, ongoing experimentation and refinement are underway to further enhance the model's performance and adaptability to evolving fraud patterns.
